    <div class="about">
        <p>Iâ€™m an experienced electrical engineer specialising in critical facilities design and power systems
          analysis. I worked in London for seven years and recently moved to Bath to begin a career as
          a software developer. I am currently a student with IO Academy on the Full Stack boot camp and
          am looking forward to progressing with my studies.
